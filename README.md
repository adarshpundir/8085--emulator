Objective:-

Tools used:-
  I prefer java for making of simulator of 8085 microprocessor because java provides you multiple libraries of inbulid functions that can be useful in this particular project.you can make this code in any language like c,c++,python etc.
  How to run program:-
  this project contains three files 
 1) Main.java
 2) operator.java
 3) conversion.java
 
 you hava to run only main file(Main.java) you can run this on command prompt of typing javac <filename> and then java <java class filename>
  or you can use ide (integrated development environment) like Netbeans,Eclipse etc.
